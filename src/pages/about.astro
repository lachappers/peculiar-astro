        Giving small businesses

        Have you ever noticed that "deer-caught-in-the-headlights" face that
        business owners pull when asked about their tech?
      </p>
      <p>
        For those of us who remember floppy disks, a whole lot has changed since
        they began their demise - not just in technology, but in business. A
        kick-ass product and excellent customer service might keep you alive,
        but alone, that's no longer enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessing affordable technology <em>and</em> understanding how to use it
        is essential, and it doesn't need to make you feel as if a 1999 Ford Fiesta
        van is about to turn you into roadside venison.
      </p>
      <p>
        I accidentally fell into technology; consulting globally for huge
        companies, later working for Google and Amazon, gaining an MBA from a
        world-leading Business School, before landing in Operations leadership
        accross the London HealthTech scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now help small and frowing businesses and Entrepreneurs find and build
        the technology they need without the smoke and mirrors, to realise the
        dynamics at play and the harness value technology can bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working as a client-facing technology developer, whilst curating
        a team of technically excellent and business-savvy humans to help us
        grow to support even more peculiar businesses.

      <p>Thank you for considering working with us!</p>
