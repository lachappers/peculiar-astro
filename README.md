## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the frontend of the Peculiar Dynamics website, which is built using AstroJS. AstroJS is a modern static site generator that focuses on performance and developer experience. We've used the accessible Astro starter template as a foundation for our website, ensuring a solid starting point for creating an accessible and user-friendly web presence.

## Features

- AstroJS: Leverage the power of AstroJS to create a high-performance static website that delivers a seamless user experience.
- Accessible Starter Template: Start with an accessible template that lays the groundwork for an inclusive website design.
- ESLint: Maintain code quality and consistency across the project using ESLint, a popular JavaScript linter.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilize Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and design. Tailwind's utility-first approach empowers rapid development.
- Google Analytics: Gain insights into your website's performance and visitor behavior with integrated Google Analytics tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js
- Git: Download and install Git

### Installation

1. Clone this repository using Git:

```bash

cd business-website
```

3. Install project dependencies:

## Usage

To start the development server and preview your website, run:

This will build and serve the website locally. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the website in action.

## Configuration

Customize the website to match your business by modifying the content, styles, and images. The project structure is organized for easy navigation:

- /src/components: Reusable components that can be used across multiple pages.

## Google Analytics Integration

Google Analytics is integrated into the website to provide insights into visitor behavior. To enable Google Analytics tracking:

1. Replace YOUR_GA_TRACKING_ID in the src/utils/ga.js file with your actual Google Analytics tracking ID.
2. The integration is already set up in the template, so data will be collected automatically.
